## Description of Dataset
The dataset I am using for my project consists of offensive statistics for NFL teams from 2019-2022. Each row of the dataset consists of the offensive statistics for a specific player in a specific game of the NFL season. Some of the numeric variables included in the dataset are passing yards, receiving yards, targets, passing touchdowns, rushing touchdowns, two-point conversions, and temperature at the game. There are also categorical variables included such as whether the game went into overtime, if the game was played in an outdoor or indoor stadium, and if the field was turf or grass. The dataset was very clean, organized, and did not appear to have any errors or duplicates. First, I subsetted the dataset to only the offfensive statistics from the year 2022. 

Here is subsetted dataset: 
```{r}
library(readr)
nfl_offensive_stats <- read_csv("derived_data/nfl_offensive_stats_subset.csv")
```


```{r}
head(nfl_offensive_stats)
```


## Analysis of Data

I picked a few variables of interest. I was interested in seeing how the total pass completions and total passing touchdowns varied among NFL teams in 2022. 

```{r}

agg_data <- nfl_offensive_stats %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(Total_Pass_Completions = sum(pass_cmp)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Pass_Completions))

agg_data$team <- reorder(agg_data$team, -agg_data$Total_Pass_Completions)

```

```{r}
head(agg_data)
```

Looking at the results from grouping the data set by NFL team and summing the total number of pass completions in 2022, we see that Los Angeles Rams had the greatest number of pass completions (146), and the Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs were tied for the second highest number (143). The team with the lowest number of pass completions was the New York Giants (19). I compiled the total pass completions into a barchart shown below.

I was also interested in comparing the total number of passing touchdowns among the NFL teams in 2022. 

```{r}
agg_data2 <- nfl_offensive_stats %>%
	group_by(team) %>%
	summarise(Total_Pass_Tds = sum(pass_td)) %>%
	arrange(desc(Total_Pass_Tds))

agg_data2$team <- reorder(agg_data2$team, -agg_data2$Total_Pass_Tds)
```

```{r}
head(agg_data2)
```

Looking at the results of grouping the subsetting data by NFL team and summing up the total amount of passing touchdowns in 2022, we see that the Chiefs had the highest number of passing touchdowns (16), and the Ravens and Commanders were tied for the lowest number of passing touchdowns (0). I compiled the results into a barchart shown below.

Next, I was interested in looking at the principal components and potential clustering of the dataset. 
I first subsetted the dataset to only include the numeric variables. Then, I performed PCA on the dataset and summarized the PCA results. Next, I calculated the variance and cumulative varaince of all the principal components. Below is the resulting figure displaying the proportion of total variance contriubted by each of the principal components as a function of the number of components. As can be seen in this plot, the cumulative proportion of variance increases as the number of principal components increases. This plot indicates that we do not need all the principal components to see most of the variance and suggests using approximately the first 20 components for further analysis.

![Cumulative Variance](figures/NFL_explained_variance.png)
Next a created a figure of just the first two principal components of the dataset. Looking at the figure below, we can see most points tend to cluster in the PC1 = (25,40), PC2 = (0, 100)
range

![Principal Components](figures/NFL_principle_components.png)
Next, I wanted to look at the PCA results with one of the specific variables of interest. I created a plot of the first two principal components and colored the points in the scatterplot based on the passing yards variable. The purpose was to see the relationship between the principal components of the offensive statistics and passing yards. We can see that most of the passing yards fall in the range of PC1 (20, 40), PC2 (0,100). We also notice most of the passing yards in the 100 yards or less category fall into the PC1 range (20,30). This suggests futher subsetting of the passing yards variable into distinct groups, so I decided to look further and perform clustering on this variable. 

![PCA_PassYds](figures/NFL_principle_components_pass_yds.png)

Next, I looked at kmeans clustering of the data specifically with some of the variables of interest. I performed kmeans clustering with 3 centers to create 3 clusters. Next, I created a density plot of passing yards and colored the points in the plot based on the three clusters. The plot allows for the display of the distribution of passing yards across the 3 clusters created. We can see cluster 1 had the highest density with passing yards in the (0, 5) range, and cluster 3 had the second highest density with passing yards moslty in the (15,30) range. 

![Cluster_PassYds](figures/Clustering_PassingYards.png)
I then looked at kmeans clustering of the data specifically for the rushing yards variable. I created a density plot of rushing yards and colored the points based on the three clusters, displaying the distribution of rushing yards across the 3 clusters created. We can see cluster 1 has the highest density with rushing yards in the (0, 5) range, and cluster 2 has the second highest density with rushing yards mostly in the (10,30) range. 

![Cluster_RushYds](figures/Clustering_RushingYards.png)
With the clustering displaying interesting findings, I decided to explore some of these variables further and create a regression model. I was interested to see if there was a linear relationship between passing touchdowns and passing yards. First, I summed up the total passing touchdowns and total passing yards for each NFL team. I fit a linear regression model with total passing touchdowns as the response variable and total passing yards as the predictor. Below is the resulting scatterplot displaying the relationship between passing touchdowns and passing yards for each NFL team. The dashed line is the regression line produced from the linear regression model. 

![Regression](figures/regression_PassTd_PassYds.png)
Looking at the plot above, we can see there is a positive correlation between total passing yards and total passing touchdowns. We see that some teams are above the fitted regression line (Chiefs, Bills, Cowboys), which indicates that these teams had more total passing touchdowns than what the linear regression model would predict based on their respective total passing yards. There are also teams below the regression model (49ers, Buccaneers, and Bengals), indicating these teams had less total passing touchdowns than what the model predicts based on their passing yards. 

Here are the results from the regression model. We can see that the model results in a significant p-value (< 0.05), indicating that we have evidence to support a linear relationship between total passing touchdowns and total passing yards. The model results indicate that with each one unit increase in passing yards, the passing touchdowns increase by about 0.0084. 

```{r}

team_stats <- nfl_offensive_stats %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(total_passing_yards = sum(pass_yds),
            total_passing_touchdowns = sum(pass_td))

regression_model <- lm(total_passing_touchdowns ~ total_passing_yards, data = team_stats)

summary(regression_model)
```

I also examined the relationship between total receiving yards for NFL wide receivers and total targets. Looking at the scatterplot below, we can see as the number of targets increased, the number of receiving yards also increased.

## Future Questions and Researh 
This project produced interesting results surrounding NFL offenisve statistics in 2022, specifically in relation to how passing touchdowns and passing completions differed among the NFL teams and how the total passing yards and rushing yards are clustered. The project also produced evidence of a linear relalationship between total passing touchdowns and total passsing yards. This analysis brings up further questions and research to be done. For example, I am interested to see other linear relationships among offensive statistics. This could include building a multivariate linear regression model and looking at for example, how a team's total score is a possible linear function of total rushing yards, total passing yards, total drops, and/or total interceptions thrown. I would also be interested in looking a the correlation of some of the categorical variables. For example, answering the question if total rushing yards is related to whether the game was played on turf/grass.
